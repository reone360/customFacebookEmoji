# customFacebookEmoji

This addon is used to change your emoji to a custom one without affecting the rest of the chat
It's pretty crude so far and sometimes it replaces some icons it shouldn't on the messenger app, but for anyone that might need it here it is

You can change the icon to the one you want by replacing the smiley emoji.

I'll work on making it more dynamic with maybe a UI to add your own, but for a rush job it'll do for now.

Since it's not a registered addon, you can only load it through the about:debugging on Firefox only.
